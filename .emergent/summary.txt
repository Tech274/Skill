**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application for the SkillTrack365 platform has been built using a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database.

The following features have been implemented and tested:
- **Core MVP:** User authentication (JWT), a global layout shell, and pages for the Certification Hub, Certification Paths, Cloud Labs, Assessments, Projects, a Skilltrack Dashboard, a Profile page, and a Stripe-integrated Checkout page.
- **Feature Batch 1:** PDF certificate generation, an assessment review mode, and the ability for users to bookmark labs and add notes.

The application has a dark, professional theme consistent with the initial design guidelines. The backend includes API endpoints for all implemented features, and the database has been seeded with initial data for certifications, labs, assessments, and projects.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a new batch of features: Leaderboard/Rankings, Discussion Forums, and Video Content integration. It has just finished creating the necessary backend models and API endpoints in , as well as the corresponding frontend pages (, , , ), adding routes in , and updating the main navigation in .

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **P1: Implement Social Sharing:** Implement the Social sharing of achievements feature, which was requested by the user but missed during the last feature implementation cycle. This will likely involve adding social media sharing buttons (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter) to the Profile page and/or the Certificate View page.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **P2: Real Cloud Environment Integration:** Replace the currently simulated cloud console in the Active Lab and Project Workspace screens with a genuine, live cloud environment integration (e.g., using a service that provides temporary cloud sandboxes).

**Completed work in this session**
- List of all completed tasks with file and method name:
  - **MVP Scaffolding:**
    - Created the entire backend structure in  with initial models and API routes for auth, certifications, labs, assessments, projects, and dashboard.
    - Created the full frontend page structure under  and the main  component.
  - **Initial Bug Fixes:**
    - Resolved multiple icon import errors across the frontend by correcting names and switching to  for consistency (e.g.,  -> ,  -> ).
